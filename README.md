Wine-Quality-Predictor

Hello there,
This is a machine learning project in which we can predict the quality of wine according to its charactistics.
I have used 2 datasets from kaggle.com here and added them so that i can have good enough amount of data to train and test the model.
The link to the Dataset:- 
  1. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset
  2. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajyellow46/wine-quality


So basically I have used the liberaries like pandas, sckit-learn and matplotlib which come handy when you need to use the graphs.
I have applied linear regression on the model and after checking the accuracy it found out to be 0.5547 which is equal to 55%.
Then I have applied the random forest classsifier on the model to classify the data properly to improve the accuracy of the model.
And finally we have the accuracy equal to 0.9463 which is almost 95%.
Thanks for reading this,
Do share your thoughts if you have anything to say about the project.
